# Introduction

Hospitality has been revolutionized by Airbnb, which offers tourists flexible living spaces that are often cheaper compared to traditional hotels. The growth of Airbnb in Bangkok, Thailand, one of the tourist destinations in Asia, is significant. However, this rapid expansion has posed a great challenge to traditional hotels as evidenced by the platformâ€™s popularity of whole homes/apartments.

The main objective of this project is to examine the state of Airbnb in Bangkok using data science techniques with respect to market dynamics, guest preferences and positioning. Through this study we will analyze classification types, host attributes such as character and price trends to realize some useful ideas for both airbnb hosts and hotel industry decision making.

# Aims:

Determine the most favored types of airbnb accommodations in Bangkok.

Study host strategies especially through comparing ASCII vs Non-ASCII names e.g. Thai , Korean or Chinese names among others.

Investigate how major listing features including prices, reviews and availability are interrelated.

Explore how traditional hotels can adapt and compete against entire home / apt (dominant) category.

Regulatory considerations and their impact on market equilibrium.

# Methodologies:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Price trends, room type distribution, host activity.

Statistical Testing: t-tests & ANOVA for comparing groups & validating hypotheses.

Visualization: Bar plots, pie charts, pairplots and geospatial mapping.

Language Feature Analysis: Assessing interaction based on the character set of host name (ASCII or non-ASCII).

# ðŸŽ¯ Outcome:

This project reveals variations in consumer behavior across listing categories, the impact of listing language and style on engagement, and some useful insights that can be used by mainstream hotels to compete with Airbnb. Through blending statistical correctness and practical applications, this analysis is relevant not only for individual owners but also for market players trying to adapt to changes in the Bangkok short-term rental sector.
